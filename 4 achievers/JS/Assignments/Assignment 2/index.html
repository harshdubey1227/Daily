        Question 1 : What are the differences between var, let and const? <br>
        Answer : Let variables can be updated but not re-declared, const variables cannot be updated or re-declared, and var variables may both be updated and re-declared inside their scope.

        Question 2 : Difference between undefined vs not defined vs NaN. <br>
        Answer : NaN - NaN stands for Not a Number. You get this value when you try to do some operation that can't yield a meaningful result. <br>
        Undefined - Undefined represents any value that has not been defined anywhere in the program. If any variable or operation isn't able to produce a meaningful value, it returns undefined. <br>
        Not defined - refers to a variable that has not been declared or defined at all.

        Question 3 : What is difference between null and undefined and where to use what? <br>
        Answer : Null in JavaScript means an empty value and is also a primitive type in JavaScript. The variable which has been assigned as null contains no value. Undefined, on the other hand, means the variable has been declared, but its value has not been assigned. <br>
        **Use null when you want to represent the intentional absence of a value, and undefined when a variable has not been assigned a value.

        Question 4 : What is execution context? <br>
        Answer : In JavaScript, the environment that enables the JavaScript code to get executed is what we call JavaScript Execution Context.

        Question 5 : What is use of prompt in JavaScript? <br>
        Answer : The JavaScript window. prompt() is a built-in function that is used to display a dialog box that asks the user to input some text. This pop-up box will appear and takes user input before entering the web page. It waits until the user enters any value in the text box or we can also cancel the dialog box.

        Question 6 : Why JavaScript is Dyanmic Language? <br>
        Answer : JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means that data types of variables are determined by the value they hold at runtime and can change throughout the program as we assign different values to them.
