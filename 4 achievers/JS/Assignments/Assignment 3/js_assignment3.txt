Q1. Write the Code for all Data types.

Ans. Integer
 let num = 123;
        console.log(num);
    o/p:- 123
    
String
    let str = "Software Developer"
      console.log(str);
  o/p:- Software Developer
    
Boolean
   let x = 10;
        let y = 20;
        let result = x>y;
        let result1 = x<y;
        console.log(result);
        console.log(result1);
    o/p:- false
          true

Array
      var x = ["java", "html", "css"];
        console.log(x);

Object
        var x = {Fisrt:"Narendra", last:"Modi"}

Null
        var x = null;
        console.log(x)
    o/p:- null

Undefined 
    var x = ;
    console.log(x)
    o/p:- x is undefined

Example of bigint
    let z = 12344566777n

Q2. What are the uses of JavaScript Operators?
Ans. Operators are used to assign values, compare values, perform arithmetic operations, and more.

Q3. Explain the Assignment Operator.
Ans. The assignment operator = assigns the value of its right-hand operand to a variable, a property, or an indexer element given by its left-hand operand.
=, +=, -=, *=, /+, %=, **

Q4. Explain the all Arithmetic Operators.
Ans. operator           Description

        +               Addition
        -               Subtraction
        *               Multiplication
        /               Division
        %               Modulus(Remainder)
        **              Exponentiation
        ++              Increment
        --              Decrement

Q5. What are the Binary Operators in js?
Ans. These operators require two operands for operation.
There are four fundamental binary operators.
        +               Addition
        -               Subtraction
        *               Multiplication
        /               Division

Q6. Explain the Pre-Increment and Post Increment in js.
Ans. In both cases, the variable num is incremented by 1. However, the pre-increment operator ++ increases the value before it is used, while the post-increment operator ++ increases the value after it is used.
