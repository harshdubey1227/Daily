        // Question 1 : Why java is platform independent kindly explain with an example
        // ?

        // Answer : Java can run on any kind of platform (operating system) . We don't
        // need to change the code of java, it will run with same code on any operating
        // system like windows, mac, linux , etc.

        // Question 2 : What is the use of void main in java ?

        // Answer : Void main is the method which is used to stop or we can say , it is
        // the stopper to return any method or function.

        // Question 3 : Why always string in main method?

        // Answer : As string is universal constant , it can hold all types of data type
        // like integer,float,boolean,etc.

        // or //

        // Because string is an universal constant non-primitive data type , string can
        // store any value like string , float , double , etc.

        // Question 4: Write a program to print swap the values. a = 10; b = 90.76

        // double a = 10;
        // double b = 90.76;

        // a = a + b;
        // b = a - b;
        // a = a - b;
        // System.out.println(a);
        // System.out.println(b);

        // Question 5 : Write a rule to define public and static ( With an example ).
        // What is the use of args in main method?

        // Answer : Public means open source, which can be used by all of us .
        // Static is used to define a data type which is outside the main method . Ex -
        // static int a = 10;
        // Args is only an argument to run program

        // Question 6 : Write a program to print true or false condition depends to you
        // , here condition is not if else.

        // Answer :
        // int a = 5;
        // int b = 15;
        // System.out.println(a < b);

        // Question 7 : Explain the difference between index and value.

        // Answer : Index is only the position of the value but value is content itself.
