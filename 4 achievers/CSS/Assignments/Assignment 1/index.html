        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet</li><br>
        <li>CSS describes how HTML, elements are to be displayed on screen,paper,or in othe media.</li><br>
        <li><span class="a"><b>CSS is not necessary</span></b> <b><span class="b"> CSS saves a lot of work.</span></b> <span class="c">It can contol the layout of multiple web pages all at once</span></li><br>
        <li> <span class="d">External stylesheet are stored in CSS files</span> </li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li class="li1">Inline- by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
        <li class="li1">Internal- by using a style elemnt in the head section</li>
        <li class="li1">External- by using a link element tyo link to an external CSS file</li>
        <li class="li1">The most common way to add CSS. is to keep the styles in external CSS files. how ever, <span class="b"> in this tutitorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate,and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="p1">When comparing CSS class vs ID,the differnce is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID, on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element.ID is also special in that you can use a special URL.to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaSript.</p>
    <p class="p2">In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a webpage.Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the elements.</p>
    <p id="p3">There is a wide range of selectors avialable.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied</p>
